Minecraft for PlayStation Portable
## How To Make
First, you need pspsdk. For Windows, download pspsdk.7z and unpack it to C:\pspsdk folder

Once that is done, you can launch compile.bat and it will compile.
After compilation, copy the compiled EBOOT.PBP to _Game folder (replace the old file) and copy the folder to your psp (put it in /PSP/GAME/)
